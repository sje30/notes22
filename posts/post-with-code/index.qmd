For your Scientific Programming assignments you are asked to put your
R code in the appendix.  See this working example for how to do this
using knitr.  This method allows you to define your functions once, either
in the main body or in the appendix, use them in the main report, and
then visually show them in the appendix.  It works using named chunks,
so that you can refer back to a chunk.

[Example Rnw file](test1.Rnw) and [Example output](test1.pdf) created by doing:

    Rscript -e 'knitr::knit2pdf("test1.Rnw")'
