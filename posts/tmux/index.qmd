There was a question about logging into subliminal and leaving a long
job running.  for this I recommend 'tmux'.

a - login to subliminal through your terminal

b - type 'tmux' (stands for terminal multiplexer).  work in that shell
for a while, and then when you want to leave something running type 'C-b
d' (for detach).  You will see the window close. It is just detached
though.

c - logout of subliminal, and then log back in.
nnnn
d - type 'tmux list-sessions'

and you should see your first session

e - type 'tmux attach' to go back to that session.

...

f - when finally you want to end that tmux session, just close the
window in tmux, using 'C-b &'.

youtube has lots of  'tmux' tutorials too.
